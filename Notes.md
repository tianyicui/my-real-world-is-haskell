## The Three Ways of Naming Types

* The `data` keyword introduces a truly new algebraic data type.
* The `type` keyword gives us a synonym to use for an existing type. We can use the type and its synonym interchangeably.
* The `newtype` keyword gives an existing type a distinct identity. The original type and the new type are _not_ interchangeable.
